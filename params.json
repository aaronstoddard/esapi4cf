Ensure that J2EE session variables be enabled! You will not be able to authenticate if this is disabled.\r\n2. The cfesapi folder should sit at the webroot level.\r\n3. Copy /cfesapi/esapi/esapi-2.0.1.jar and selected files from /cfesapi/esapi/libs/ to your lib folder (see compatibility below).\r\n4. Restart ColdFusion.\r\nNOTE: there are folders included with CFESAPI that you will want to exclude from your production environment\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n- You will need to create an 'esapi' folder under your User Home directory so the users.txt file can be written to disk i.e. C:\\Users\\myusername\\esapi\\\r\n- You can run the MXUnit tests using: /cfesapi/test/TestSuite.cfm\r\n\r\nDemos:\r\n- See the /cfesapi/demo/ for basic examples of implementation. **Be sure to have https setup else you can't login.**\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\n- You can extend any of the default implementations to overwrite the methods you need\r\n and/or\r\n- You can create new implementations that implement the provided interfaces\r\n\r\nHow:\r\n- Copy the /cfesapi/esapi/configuration/esapi/ folder to a location within your CF application and make changes to your copy of the config files\r\n- ESAPI.properties\r\n\t- IMPORTANT: Run /cfesapi/org/owasp/esapi/reference/crypto/JavaEncryptor.cfm to calculate your *own* Encryptor.MasterKey and Encryptor.MasterSalt values\r\n\t- Update the component paths with the location of your implementation components\r\n\t- Modify other configs as needed\r\n- Include the /cfesapi/helpers/ESAPI.cfm in your application\r\n- Call the filters provided by CFESAPI to secure and authenticate each request.\r\n- See demos for examples\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n- You can determine whether unlimited strength crypto is installed by running: /cfesapi/test/org/owasp/esapi/reference/crypto/CryptoPolicy.cfm\r\n","tagline":"OWASP ESAPI for ColdFusion/CFML Project"}
