		<h2>What is ESAPI4CF?</h2>
	</div>
	<p>ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. The ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation for new development. Allowing for language-specific differences, all OWASP ESAPI versions have the same basic design:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There is a set of security control interfaces. They define for example types of parameters that are passed to types of security controls.</li>
		<li>There is a reference implementation for each security control. The logic is not organization-specific and the logic is not application-specific. An example: string-based input validation.</li>
		<li>There are optionally your own implementations for each security control. There may be application logic contained in these classes which may be developed by or for your organization. An example: enterprise authentication.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<div class="page-header">
		<h2>Why use ESAPI4CF?</h2>
	</div>
	<p>If you are only concerned with leveraging some encoders for XSS prevention on a few pages then ESAPI4CF is probably not for you.  You can very easily use the Encoder module of the esapi.jar included with the CFML engines to accomplish this.  There are several articles out there on how to accomplish this.</p>
	<p>But if you want to take security seriously and take control of the Authentication, Authorization, Encoding, Encryption, Execution, Intrusion Detection, Validation, and Logging of your web applications, you need ESAPI4CF.</p>
	<p>In case you were not aware, even if you choose to just use the Encoder module directly from the esapi.jar like mentioned above, any validation exceptions thrown by the Encoder module get logged by the Logger module.  Included with that logging is information like the authenticated user, timestamp, IP address, CSRF token and a few other very important pieces of information.  However, because the esapi.jar is coded to work with Java and its session management the authenticated user logged will never be tied to your authentication mechansim of your web application. That makes for some pretty useless encoder exception logs.</p>
	<p>This is where ESAPI4CF comes in.  ESAPI4CF provides CF wrappers around all of the modules of ESAPI4J which means you and CF can tap into the power of each module including the Authenticator giving you the ability to implement your user base and authentication methods.  Back to our Encoder example, with your own user base and authentication implemented all logging will now reflect your authenticated user rather than an anonymous user.  And let's also add that the Encoder is not the only module which leverages the Logger module... they all do!  Let's now add onto this that the Logger module, like all the modules, can be overridden with your own implementation so you can place these logs wherever you would like.</p>
	<p>Now doesn't that sound so much better than a few encoders here and there? Take the security of your web application seriously and use the right tools for the job.</p>

	<div class="page-header">
		<h2>ESAPI Compatibility</h2>
	</div>
	<p>ESAPI4CF is written is to compatible with the oldest ESAPI4J version included with the supported CFML engines. Below is the list of the ESAPI4CF version and its appropriate ESAPI4J compatibility.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>ESAPI4CF 1.x - based on ESAPI4J v1.4.4 specifications</li>
		<!--<li><span class="label label-info">FUTURE</span> ESAPI4CF 2.x - will be based on ESAPI4J v2.0_rc10 specifications</li>-->
	</ul>
	
	<div class="page-header">
		<h2>CFML Compatibility</h2>
	</div>
	<p>ESAPI4CF is designed to work with the esapi.jar included with the latest versions of each CFML engine.  The esapi.jar is not included with ESAPI4CF.</p>
	<h3>ESAPI4CF 1.0 <span class="label label-info">alpha</span></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Railo 4.0 (ESAPI4J v2.0.1)</li>
		<li>ColdFusion 9.0.2 (ESAPI4J v2.0_rc10)</li>
		<li>ColdFusion 8.0.1  (ESAPI4J v1.4.4 - requires Adobe security hotfix)</li>
	</ul>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/damonmiller/esapi4cf/issues/39">Issue 39</a> is preventing compatibility with the below versions.  A workaround is currently being investigated.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Railo 4.1 (ESAPI4J v2.0.1)</li>
		<li>ColdFusion 10.x (ESAPI4J v2.0.1)</li>
	</ul>
	<!--<h3><span class="label label-info">IN DEVELOPMENT</span> ESAPI4CF 2.0</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Railo 4.x (ESAPI4J v2.0.1)</li>
		<li>ColdFusion 10.x (ESAPI4J v2.0.1)</li>
		<li>ColdFusion 9.0.2 (ESAPI4J v2.0_rc10)</li>
	</ul>-->

	<div class="page-header">
		<h2>Keep it updated!</h2>
	</div>
	<p>It is highly recommended that you apply all hotfixes to your CFML instances to help ensure the highest security of your web applications.  Both Railo and ColdFusion 10 include automatic updaters.  If you are running an older ColdFusion version you must apply the hotfixes manually or use the <a href="http://www.uu-2.info/">Unofficial Updater 2</a>.</p>
	<p>You should also ensure that you are running the latest JVM version applicable to your CFML engine.  Railo 4, ColdFusion 10, and ColdFusion 9.0.2 support JDK 1.7.x (once the latest Adobe hotfixes are applied) and ColdFusion 8.0.1 supports JDK 1.6.x.</p>
